# How to read and interact with each chapter

Each chapter has its own `README.md` file where you can find what you will learn in that chapter, an exercise and 
how to run the code.

Each time your test is wrong, you get a hint to help you to find the solution, and if you are stuck, you can find the
solution in the `solution` folder.
